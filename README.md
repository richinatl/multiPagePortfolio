# multiPagePortfolio

This is a rework of my original portfolio with some implementation and styling changes. Among the styling changes I addded a modest animation for the H1 that I really like. I also added a contact form on the front end with ambition of adding a back-end if time permits to handle requests. For now the contact form only returns an alert to use my cell, email, LinkedIn, or Github. I may make some more styling changes in the future, I'll probably test them here and then update my single page application if I decide they're better. As I often say, the learning and practice in software development never ends, and that's one of my favorite things about it
